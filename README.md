# CSC_361
The code in this folder pertains to the projects/assignments I completed for CSC 361: Networks and Communications Systems. 
In this course we learned how to setup TCP and UDP based clients and servers and learned about how information is sent through the internet accompanied by TCP and UDP headers.
# SWS.PY
in the project sws.py we created a simple web server which recieves TCP requests and sents appropriate files in response. 
Additionally it logs all the sent and recieved information.
# SOR-CLIENT.PY & SOR-SERVER.PY
In SOR-CLIENT and SOR-SERVER using UDP we created a client and server which interact with each other utilizing reliable datagram protocols.
# Developers Notes:
All these projects have remained unedited to show what I am able to accomplish in a limited time frame.
The first project received an A+ and the second recieved an A-.
# Future Development:
I have the ambition to work in a company that works with communications systems and networks to a certain degree and I hope to presistently expand upon my knowledge of the field.
Personally I feel as though this class challenged me a lot academically and yet I was always motivated to work hard to perform well on the assignments.
